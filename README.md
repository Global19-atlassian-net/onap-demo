ONAP HEAT Template
---

The ONAP HEAT template spins up the entire ONAP platform. The template, onap_openstack.yaml, comes with an environment file, onap_openstack.env, in which all the default values are defined.

NOTE: onap_openstack.yaml AND onap_openstack.env ARE THE HEAT TEMPLATE AND ENVIRONMENT FILE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED. onap_openstack_float.yaml/env AND onap_openstack_nofloat.yaml/env AREN'T UPDATED AND THEIR USAGE IS NOT SUGGESTED.

The HEAT template is composed of two sections: (i) parameters, and (ii) resources. The parameter section contains the declaration and description of the parameters that will be used to spin up ONAP, such as public network identifier, URLs of code and artifacts repositories, etc.
The default values of these parameters can be found in the environment file. The resource section contains the definition of:
 - ONAP Private Management Network, which ONAP components use to communicate with each other and with VNFs
 - ONAP Virtual Machines (VMs)
 - Public/private key pair used to access ONAP VMs
 - Virtual interfaces towards the ONAP Private Management Network
 - Disk volumes. 

Each VM specification includes Operating System image name, VM size (i.e. flavor), VM name, etc. Each VM has two virtual network interfaces: one towards the public network and one towards the ONAP Private Management network, as described above. 
Furthermore, each VM runs a post-instantiation script that downloads and installs software dependencies (e.g. Java JDK, gcc, make, Python, ...) and ONAP software packages and docker containers from remote repositories.

When the HEAT template is executed, the Openstack HEAT engine creates the resources defined in the HEAT template, based on the parameters values defined in the environment file.

Before running HEAT, it is necessary to customize the environment file. Indeed, some parameters, namely public_net_id, pub_key, openstack_tenant_id, openstack_username, and openstack_api_key, need to be set depending on the user's environment:

        public_net_id:       PUT YOUR NETWORK ID/NAME HERE
        pub_key:             PUT YOUR PUBLIC KEY HERE
        openstack_tenant_id: PUT YOUR OPENSTACK PROJECT ID HERE
        openstack_username:  PUT YOUR OPENSTACK USERNAME HERE
        openstack_api_key:   PUT YOUR OPENSTACK PASSWORD HERE
        horizon_url:         PUT THE HORIZON URL HERE
        keystone_url:        PUT THE KEYSTONE URL HERE (do not include version number)


openstack_region parameter is set to RegionOne (OpenStack default). If your OpenStack is using another Region, please modify this parameter.

public_net_id is the unique identifier (UUID) or name of the public network of the cloud provider. To get the public_net_id, use the following OpenStack CLI command (ext is the name of the external network, change it with the name of the external network of your installation) 

        openstack network list  | grep ext |  awk '{print $2}'   


pub_key is string value of the public key that will be installed in each ONAP VM. To create a public/private key pair in Linux, please execute the following instruction:
   
        user@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

The following operations to create the public/private key pair occur:
   
        Generating public/private rsa key pair.
        Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): 
        Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.
        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
        Enter same passphrase again: 
        Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
        Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

openstack_username, openstack_tenant_id (password), and openstack_api_key are user's credentials to access the OpenrStack-based cloud. Note that in the Rackspace web interface, openstack_api_key can be found by clicking on the username on the top-right corner of the GUI and then "Account Settings".

Some global parameters used for all components are also required:
        ubuntu_1404_image: PUT THE UBUNTU 14.04 IMAGE NAME HERE
        ubuntu_1604_image: PUT THE UBUNTU 16.04 IMAGE NAME HERE
        flavor_small: PUT THE SMALL FLAVOR NAME HERE
        flavor_medium: PUT THE MEDIUM FLAVOR NAME HERE
        flavor_large: PUT THE LARGE FLAVOR NAME HERE
        flavor_xlarge: PUT THE XLARGE FLAVOR NAME HERE
        flavor_xxlarge: PUT THE XXLARGE FLAVOR NAME HERE

To get the images in your OpenStack environment, use the following OpenStack CLI command:

        openstack image list | grep 'ubuntu'

To get the flavor names used in your OpenStack environment, use the following OpenStack CLI command:

        openstack flavor list

Some network parameters must be configured
        dns_list: PUT THE ADDRESS OF THE EXTERNAL DNS HERE (e.g. a comma-separated list of IP addresses in your /etc/resolv.conf in UNIX-based Operating Systems).  THIS LIST MUST INCLUDE THE DNS SERVER THAT OFFERS DNS AS AS SERVICE (see DCAE section below for more details)
        external_dns: PUT THE FIRST ADDRESS OF THE EXTERNAL DNS LIST HERE
        oam_network_cidr: 10.0.0.0/16

You can use the Google Public DNS 8.8.8.8 and 4.4.4.4 address or your internal DNS servers

DCAE spins up ONAP's data collection and analytics system in two phases.  The first is the launching of a bootstrap VM that is specified in the ONAP Heat template.  This VM requires a number of deployment specific conifiguration parameters being provided so that it can subsequently bring up the DCAE system.  There are two groups of parameters.  The first group relates to the launching of DCAE VMs, including parameters such as the keystone URL and additional VM image IDs/names.  DCAE VMs are connected to the same internal network as the rest of ONAP VMs, but dynamically spun up by the DCAE core platform.  Hence these parameters need to be provided to DCAE.  Note that although DCAE VMs will be launched in the same tenant as the rest of ONAP, because DCAE may use MultiCloud node as the agent for interfacing with the underying cloud, it needs a separate keystone URL (which points to MultiCloud node instead of the underlying cloud).  The second group of configuration parameters relate to DNS As A Service support (DNSaaS).  DCAE requires DNSaaS for registering its VMs into organization-wide DNS service.  For OpenStack, DNSaaS is provided by Designate.  Designate support can be provided via an integrated service endpoint listed under the service catalog of the OpenStack installation; or proxyed by the ONAP MultiCloud service.  For the latter case, a number of parameters are needed to configure MultiCloud to use the correct Designate service.  These parameters are described below:

        dcae_keystone_url: PUT THE KEYSTONE URL OF THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DCAE IS DEPLOYED (Note: put the MultiCloud proxy URL if the DNSaaS is proxyed by MultiCloud)
        dcae_centos_7_image: PUT THE CENTOS7 IMAGE ID/NAME AVAILABLE AT THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DCAE IS DEPLOYED
        dcae_security_group: PUT THE SECURITY GROUP ID/NAME TO BE USED AT THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DCAE IS DEPLOYED
        dcae_key_name: PUT THE ACCESS KEY-PAIR NAME REGISTER AT THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DCAE IS DEPLOYED
        dcae_public_key: PUT THE PUBLIC KEY OF A KEY-PAIR USED FOR DCAE BOOTSTRAP NODE TO COMMUNICATE WITH DCAE VMS
        dcae_private_key: PUT THE PRIVATE KEY OF A KEY-PAIR USED FOR DCAE BOOTSTRAP NODE TO COMMUNICATE WITH DCAE VMS

        dnsaas_config_enabled: true for false FOR WHETHER DNSAAS IS PROXYED
        dnsaas_region: PUT THE REGION OF THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DNSAAS IS PROVIDED
        dnsaas_tenant_id: PUT THE TENANT ID/NAME OF THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DNSAAS IS PROVIDED
        dnsaas_keystone_url: PUT THE KEYSTONE URL OF THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DNSAAS IS PROVIDED
        dnsaas_username: PUT THE USERNAME OF THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DNSAAS IS PROVIDED
        dnsaas_password: PUT THE PASSWORD OF THE OPENSTACK INSTANCE WHERE DNSAAS IS PROVIDED


The ONAP platform can be instantiated via Horizon (OpenStack dashboard) or Command Line.

Instantiation via Horizon:
 - Login to Horizon URL with your personal credentials
 - Click "Stacks" from the "Orchestration" menu
 - Click "Launch Stack"
 - Paste or manually upload the HEAT template file (onap_openstack.yaml) in the "Template Source" form
 - Paste or manually upload the HEAT environment file (onap_openstack.env) in the "Environment Source" form
 - Click "Next"
 - Specify a name in the "Stack Name" form
 - Provide the password in the "Password" form
 - Click "Launch" 

Instantiation via Command Line:
 - Install the HEAT client on your machine, e.g. in Ubuntu (ref. http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html):

        apt-get install python-dev python-pip
        pip install python-heatclient        # Install heat client
        pip install python-openstackclient   # Install the Openstack client to support multiple services
 
 - Create a file (named i.e. ~/openstack/openrc) that sets all the environmental variables required to access Rackspace:

        export OS_AUTH_URL=INSERT THE AUTH URL HERE
        export OS_USERNAME=INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE
        export OS_TENANT_ID=INSERT YOUR TENANT ID HERE
        export OS_REGION_NAME=INSERT THE REGION HERE
        export OS_PASSWORD=INSERT YOUR PASSWORD HERE
        
 - Run the script from command line:

        source ~/openstack/openrc
        
 - In order to install the ONAP platform, type:

        heat stack-create STACK_NAME -f PATH_TO_HEAT_TEMPLATE(YAML FILE) -e PATH_TO_ENV_FILE       # Old HEAT client, OR
        openstack stack create -t PATH_TO_HEAT_TEMPLATE(YAML FILE) -e PATH_TO_ENV_FILE STACK_NAME  # New Openstack client


VNFs HEAT Templates
---

The HEAT templates for the demo applications are stored in heat/vFW and heat/vLB directories. 

vFW contains the HEAT template, base_vfw.yaml, and the environment file, base_vfw.env, that are used to instantiate a virtual firewall. The VNF is composed of three VMs:
  - Packet generator
  - Firewall
  - Sink

The packet generator generates traffic that passes through the firewall and reaches the sink. The firewall periodically reports the number of packets received in a unit of time to the DCAE collector. If the reported number of packets received on the firewall is above a high-water mark or below a low-water mark, ONAP will enforce a configuration change on the packet generator, reducing or augmenting the quantity of traffic generated, respectively.

vLB contains the HEAT template, base_vlb.yaml, and the environment file, base_vlb.env, that are used to spin up a virtual load balancer and a virtual DNS. vLB also contains the HEAT template, packet_gen_vlb.yaml, and the environment file packet_gen_vlb.env, of a packet generator that generates DNS queries.
The load balancer periodically reports the number of DNS query packets received in a time unit to the DCAE collector. If the reported number of received packets crosses a threshold, then ONAP will spin up a new DNS based on the dnsscaling.yaml HEAT template and dnsscaling.env to better balance the load of incoming DNS queries.

The vFW and vLB HEAT templates and environment files are onboarded into ONAP SDC and run automatically. The user is not required to run these templates manually.
However, before onboarding the templates following the instructions in the ONAP documentation, the user should set the following values in the environment files:

        public_net_id:       INSERT YOUR NETWORK ID/NAME HERE
        pub_key:             INSERT YOUR PUBLIC KEY HERE
        

ONAP Demo applications
---

Demo applications are installed and run automatically when the VNFs are instantiated. The user is not supposed to download and install the demo applications manually.

Two demo applications, vFirewall and vLoadBalancer/vDNS are included. 

vFirewall
---

The vFirewall application contains 3 VMs: a firewall, a packet generator, and a packet sink. 

The packet generator sends packets to the packet sink through the firewall. The firewall reports the volume of traffic from the packet generator to the sink to ONAP DCAE’s collector. To check the traffic volume to the sink, you can access the link http://sink_ip_address:667 through your browser. You can see the traffic volume in the charts. 

The packet generator includes a script that periodically generates different volumes of traffic. 

The closed-loop policy has been configured to re-adjust the traffic volume when it is needed.

__Closedloop for vFirewall demo:__

Through the ONAP Portal’s Policy Portal, we can find the configuration and operation policies that is currently enabled for the vFirewall application. 
+ The configuration policy sets the thresholds for generating an onset event from DCAE to the Policy engine. Currently the thresholds are set to 300 packets and 700 packets, while the measurement interval is set to 10 seconds. 
+ Once one of the thresholds is crossed (e.g. the number of received packets is below 300 packets or above 700 per 10 seconds), the Policy engine executes the operational policy to request APP-C to change the configuration of the packet generator. 
+ APP-C sends a request to the packet generator to adjust the traffic volume to 500 packets per 10 seconds. 
+ The traffic volume can be observed through the link http://sink_ip_address:667.

__Adjust packet generator:__

The packet generator contains 10 streams: fw_udp1, fw_udp2, fw_udp3,...fw_udp10. Each stream generates 100 packets per 10 seconds. 

To enable a stream, include *{"id":"fw_udp1", "is-enabled":"true"}* in the *pg-stream* bracket. 

To adjust the traffic volume sending from the packet generator, run the following command that enable 5 streams in a shell with localhost or the correct packet generator IP address in the http argument:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -d '{"pg-streams":{"pg-stream": [{"id":"fw_udp1", "is-enabled":"true"},{"id":"fw_udp2", "is-enabled":"true"},{"id":"fw_udp3", "is-enabled":"true"},{"id":"fw_udp4", "is-enabled":"true"},{"id":"fw_udp5", "is-enabled":"true"}]}}' "http://PacketGen_IP:8183/restconf/config/sample-plugin:sample-plugin/pg-streams"
```

A script in /opt/run_traffic_fw_demo.sh on the packet generator VM starts automatically and alternate the volume of traffic every 5 minutes. 

vLoadBalancer/vDNS
---

The vLoadBalancer/vDNS app contains 2 VMs in the base model: a load balancer and a DNS instance. When there are too many DNS queries, the closed-loop is triggered and a new DNS instance will be spun up. 

To test the application, in the command prompt:

``` 
# nslookup host1.dnsdemo.onap.org *vLoadBalancer_IP*

Server:     *vLoadBalancer_IP*
Address:    *vLoadBalancer_IP*

Name:     host1.dnsdemo.onap.org
Address:  10.0.100.101

```

That means the load balancer has been set up correctly and has forwarded the DNS queries to the DNS instance. 

__Closedloop for vLoadBalancer/vDNS:__

Through the Policy Portal (accessible via the ONAP Portal), we can find the configuration and operation policies that are currently enabled for the vLoadBalancer/vDNS application. 
+ The configuration policy sets the thresholds for generating an onset event from DCAE to the Policy engine. Currently the threshold is set to 200 packets, while the measurement interval is set to 10 seconds. 
+ Once the threshold is crossed (e.g. the number of received packets is above 200 packets per 10 seconds), the Policy engine executes the operational policy to query A&AI and send a request to MSO for spinning up a new DNS instance. 
+ A new DNS instance will be then spun up.


__Generate DNS queries:__

To generate DNS queries to the vLoadBalancer/vDNS instance, a separate packet generator is prepared for this purpose. 

1. Spin up the heat template in the repository: https://link_to_repo/demo/heat/vLB/packet_gen_vlb.yaml. 

2. Log in to the packet generator instance through ssh.

3. Change the IP address in the config file /opt/config/vlb_ipaddr.txt to the public IP address of the LoadBalancer instance. 

4. Execute the script /opt/vdnspacketgen_change_streams_ports.sh to restart sending the DNS queries to the new LoadBalancer address. 

5. To change the volume of queries, execute the following command in a command prompt with the updated vLoadBalancer_IP address or localhost in the http argument:
 
```  
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -d '{"pg-streams":{"pg-stream": [{"id":"dns1", "is-enabled":"true"}]}}' "http://vLoadBalancer_IP:8183/restconf/config/sample-plugin:sample-plugin/pg-streams"  
```  
+ *{"id":"dns1", "is-enabled":"true"}* shows the stream *dns1* is enabled. The packet generator sends requests in the rate of 100 packets per 10 seconds.  

+ To increase the amount of traffic, we can enable more streams. The packet generator has 10 streams, *dns1*, *dns2*, *dns3* to *dns10*. Each of them generates 100 packets per 10 seconds. To enable the streams, please insert *{"id":"dnsX", "is-enabled":"true"}* where *X* is the stream ID in the pg-stream bracket of the curl command.  
For example, if we want to enable 3 streams, the curl command should be:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -d '{"pg-streams":{"pg-stream": [{"id":"dns1", "is-enabled":"true"}, {"id":"dns2", "is-enabled":"true"},{"id":"dns3", "is-enabled":"true"}]}}' "http://vLoadBalancer_IP:8183/restconf/config/sample-plugin:sample-plugin/pg-streams"
```
